## The tool

This tool is coded with p5js and is used to create a graphic composition of simple colored shapes with an image in the background. The size of the composition depends on the size of the browser window.

The tool's parameters are as follows:

- Add an image to the background
- Grid density (columns and rows)
- Addition and removal of background colors for shapes
- Addition or removal of empty spaces in the grid
- Drag and drop the settings window
- Choose all 4 shapes or just one
- Downloading of the final composition

(The background image was created using the incredible [Gradientor](https://gradientor.afterimage.cc/) tool by Anatoly Grashchenko.)
